MEET?A MEET Event occurs whenever two or more Entities come together at a single location and interact with one another face-to-face.  MEET Events include talks, summits, conferences, meetings, visits, and any other Event where two or more parties get together at some location. ?Bush and Putin met earlier this week to discuss Chechnya. ?met
PHONE-WRITE?A PHONE-WRITE Event occurs when two or more people directly engage in discussion which does not take place ‘face-to-face’.  To make this Event less open-ended, we limit it to written or telephone communication where at least two parties are specified. Communication that takes place in person should be considered a MEET Event.  The very common ‘PERSON told reporters’ is not a taggable Event, nor is ‘issued a statement’.  A PHONE-WRITE Event must be explicit phone or written communication between two or more parties. ?John sent an e-mail to Jane. ?sent
